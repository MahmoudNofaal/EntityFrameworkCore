///- It refers to populating the database with the initial set of data during initialization

///-> Using [HasData] method in [OnModelingCreating] to define static data as a part of migration.
///-> Custom Seeding: executes at app startup, allowing dynamic data (ex: from JSON or API).
///* Why It Matters:
///  Ensures the database has required data (ex: default roles, lookup tables) for the app
///  to function correctly (work correctly).
